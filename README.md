## Projects
- **Few Shot Tabular Learning**
  * Team up GNN and SOTA Tabular Models. Exploring GNNâ€™s potential in few-shot tabular tasks.
  *  Tech Stack: Tree-based model, Transformer, Large Language Model(LLM), Graph Convolutional Network(GCN), HuggingFace

- **Fake News Detection**
  * Developed a robust detection model that achieves 95% accuracy in classifying news content as real or fake.
  * Tech Stack: Large Language Model(LLM), Graph Convolutional Network(GCN), HuggingFace

- **Mission Undercover**
  * Developed a real-time multiplayer online game by JAVA & socket-programming & VPN tool(Hamachi)

- **Pic18 Microprocessor boxing game**
  * Developed a classic joystick-controlled boxing game using a PIC18 microprocessor, C#, and Unity.

- **Base Station Simulator**
  * Write a simulator using Python with the Pygame library to model a city with multiple base stations of varying bandwidths and a variable number of mobile devices. The devices will connect to the base stations using four different algorithms, and the simulator will compare the signal strength under each algorithm.


- **Simple Go compiler**
  * Developed a simple Go Compiler using lex and yacc
  * First, implement a scanner using Lex, then create a parser with Yacc, and use a symbol table to record each variable and function. Next, generate Java bytecode for each instruction so that the program can execute smoothly.
